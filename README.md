# impTransition
initial PoShowTube code, back in the days 

This was the initial processing code I started with when creating PoShowTube  https://www.poshowtube.com/home.php

Things got too big and I had to move to Eclipse/Java/JavaFX but this still has some useful examples for people starting up with processing, things like...

- examples of using minim
- examples of using controlP5
- examples of using FFT
- processing code
